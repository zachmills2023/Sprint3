## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] I included a class to create a bar chart, but was unable to get it to run because it seems like I ran out of API requests for awhile
* [ ] I would like to have the bar chart display from the user's input
* [ ] I would also like to include more options on the main menu, maybe make it either the bar chart or the terminal output
* [ ] I would also like to make it so that the user can save the stock prices to a file for later
* [ ] I would like to read previous stock prices from files to see the history and then make a trend line based on stock fluctuations
